# Authentication Setup Guide

## ✅ Setup Complete!

The authentication system has been set up and is now ready to use.

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Database Migration
**Issue:** The `users` table didn't exist in the database.

**Solution:** Ran the migration:
```bash
psql $DATABASE_URL -f database/migrations/005_create_users_table.sql
```

### 2. JWT Secret Key
**Issue:** No `JWT_SECRET` environment variable was set.

**Solution:** Added JWT_SECRET to `.env`:
```bash
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key-change-in-production-[random-hash]
```

### 3. Server Restart
**Issue:** Server needed restart to pick up new environment variables.

**Solution:** Restarted dev server with `npm run dev`

## Testing Authentication

### Register a New User
1. Open http://localhost:5173
2. Click "Sign up" on the login page
3. Enter:
   - Full Name (optional)
   - Email address
   - Password (minimum 6 characters)
4. Click "Create Account"

### Login with Existing User
1. Open http://localhost:5173
2. Enter your email and password
3. Click "Sign In"

### Logout
1. Once logged in, look for the "Logout" option in the navigation menu
2. Click "Logout" to end your session

## Features

### ✅ User Authentication
- Email/password registration
- Secure password hashing (bcrypt)
- JWT tokens with 30-day expiration
- Persistent login sessions

### ✅ Protected Routes
- Only logged-in users can access the dashboard
- Automatic redirect to login page when not authenticated
- User-specific video data isolation

### ✅ User Interface
- Beautiful dark theme login page
- User info display in sidebar and mobile header
- Logout button in navigation menu
- Loading states and error handling

## Production Deployment

When deploying to production, make sure to:

1. **Run the database migration:**
   ```bash
   psql $DATABASE_URL -f database/migrations/005_create_users_table.sql
   ```

2. **Set a strong JWT_SECRET:**
   ```bash
   # Generate a secure random key
   openssl rand -hex 32
   
   # Add to your .env file
   JWT_SECRET=your-generated-key-here
   ```

3. **Update env.production.example** with your JWT_SECRET

4. **Restart your server** after updating environment variables

## Security Notes

- ✅ Passwords are hashed with bcrypt (10 salt rounds)
- ✅ JWT tokens expire after 30 days
- ✅ User data is isolated per user account
- ✅ Input validation on both frontend and backend
- ⚠️ Make sure to use a strong, unique JWT_SECRET in production
- ⚠️ Use HTTPS in production to protect credentials in transit

## Troubleshooting

### "Invalid email or password" error
- Check that you registered with the correct email
- Passwords are case-sensitive
- Minimum password length is 6 characters

### Can't create account - "User already exists"
- This email is already registered
- Try logging in instead or use a different email

### Page keeps showing login screen
- Check browser console for errors
- Make sure JWT_SECRET is set in .env
- Make sure users table exists in database
- Try clearing browser localStorage and cookies

### Server errors
- Check that the database migration ran successfully
- Verify DATABASE_URL is correct in .env
- Check server logs for detailed error messages

## Next Steps

Now that authentication is working, you can:
1. Create user accounts for testing
2. Add user-specific video filtering
3. Implement user settings/preferences
4. Add password reset functionality (future enhancement)
5. Add email verification (future enhancement)
