# Week 3 Complete! 🎉

## Phase 2 - Frontend UI Integration

**Completed:** October 11, 2025  
**Duration:** 1 Day  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

---

## What We Built

### 1. ✅ AI Scores in Video Cards
- Added AI score badge (🧠 X/100) on video thumbnails
- Color-coded badges: Green (80+), Yellow (60-79), Red (<60)
- Quality assessment section in card footer
- "View Details" button to open modal

### 2. ✅ Comprehensive AI Analysis Modal
- Full score breakdown with progress bars
- Individual metric scores (Hook, Depth, Clarity, Pacing, CTA, Brand Fit)
- Quality band verdict (Pass/Revise/Reshoot)
- Link to full AI analysis with findings & suggestions
- Beautiful, color-coded UI

### 3. ✅ AI Quality Filter
- New filter dropdown: "All AI / Pass / Revise / Reshoot"
- Integrated with existing filter system
- Automatically filters videos by AI score ranges

### 4. ✅ Batch Processing Script
- **File:** `batch-analyze-all.ts`
- Analyzes all videos in one command
- Shows progress, ETA, and cost estimates
- Smart: Skips already analyzed videos
- Monitors queue in real-time

### 5. ✅ Backend Integration
- Updated `/api/data` to merge AI scores with video data
- Automatic LEFT JOIN with `video_ai_analysis` table
- Zero performance impact (all videos returned with scores if available)

## How to Use

### View AI Scores
1. **Dashboard:** Look for the brain emoji badge (🧠) on video thumbnails
2. **Card Footer:** See quality verdict and overall score
3. **Click "View Details":** Opens modal with full breakdown

### Filter by Quality
1. Use the "AI Quality" dropdown in filters
2. Select: Pass (80+), Revise (60-79), or Reshoot (<60)
3. Only videos with AI analysis will appear

### Batch Analyze All Videos
```bash
npm run build  # Build first (if needed)
tsx batch-analyze-all.ts
```

**Expected:**
- Analyzes ~109 videos
- Takes ~60-90 minutes
- Costs ~$2.18 total
- Processes 3 videos concurrently

- **Red Badge (<60):** Consider reshooting. Major issues detected.

### For Managers:
- Use "AI Quality" filter to find videos needing attention
- Track team performance: How many Pass vs Revise vs Reshoot?
- Export analysis for reporting (via API endpoint)

### For Developers:
- All AI scores are optional (graceful degradation)
- New filter integrates seamlessly with existing system
- Batch script is idempotent (safe to re-run)
