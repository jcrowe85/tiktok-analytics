So one question we get a lot is what makes our product so unique? What''s different about it than anything else you might find on the market? And particularly, this comes down to like oils and other serums. So first of all, with oils, oils are great, but oils are more so superficial. Those are going to work on top of the scalp. They''re going to help with antifreeze. They''re going to help with shine. They''re going to help with balancing the pH of your scalp. So they''re great for those things. But in terms of their ability to help regrow or grow new hair to broaden the actual hair follicle to give you thicker hair, they''re not necessarily great for that. So they''re really separate. In terms of serums that are on the marketplace, most of them are using more natural remedies, which are great, botanicals. You''ve got caffeine and tea tree oil and things of that nature. But those aren''t really built either for communicating at a cellular level in order to promote and stimulate hair growth that you''re looking for. Our product, on the other hand, has peptides in it, and peptides are unique in a couple of different ways. First of all, they have very small molecular weight and size, making it easy for them to get past the skin barrier. So you have top of your head, you''ve got this layer. It''s like a brick and mortar layer. And the bricks are these hardened skin cells and they''re impenetrable. You can''t get through them. But between those, the mortar, the cements in a brick wall are this liposomal matrix, these little bubbles that are tightly packed together. And that is really your way to get down deep into the dermis. You want to reach what they call the dermal papilla, which is your hair manufacturer. So what''s different about peptides? Well, they''ve got a better chance of making it through the liposomal matrix because of their small weight and size. So typically you want 500 Daltons or less in terms of your molecular mass. And you also want 500 nanometers or smaller. That''ll help the chances of getting deep down into the dermis where your hair factory is. Once they get there, they''re able to send messages to the cell, such as stimulate hair growth. We want to keep your hair in the antigen phase longer, the growth phase longer. Other things like angiogenesis, where we''re broadening or bringing more blood flow to the hair follicle to broaden that hair follicle, give you thicker hair. So those are the couple of differences between peptides and some of the other things you see in the market. It''s state of the art stuff. I mean, a lot of companies you''ll see nowadays are starting to move into the peptide space. We''ve got one of the most advanced peptide products on the market. We''ve got six active biopeptides in here. GHK-CU, it''s copper tripeptide. AHK-CU, same thing. PALA-HK, GHK-BASIC, TTD-DBM. You can do the research on each of these, open Google, open chat, compare it to the ingredients of all the products you''re using, and you will see this is cutting edge technology. So if you guys are interested, I''ve gone ahead and tagged our product in the description below, just click that. You can buy directly through the TikTok store. And yeah, we''d love to see you guys trying out a product. We''ve got a 30-day money-back guarantee on a single product, single item. We''ve also got a 90-day money-back guarantee on the Trio. So right now we''ve got a buy two and get a third one free, $76. It ends up coming out to about $25 a product, which is more affordable than any of the other big brands selling right now, so yeah, give us a try. Let us know what you think. You''ve got a 30 or 90 days in a money-back, no questions asked, just return the bottles and that''s it. All right, thanks so much."}', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2025-10-11 04:37:45.327523', '2025-10-11 04:38:10.636539');

Celebrities like Tyra Banks, Kaira Knightley, Rikki Lake, and Jussie Nelson have all been very public about suffering from a variety of hair loss issues. Most think their secret is better medical doctors or specialized and expensive treatments. Others think they''re using basic remedies like rosemary oil or expensive shampoos and conditioners, but that couldn''t be further from the truth. Maybe that''s self-wasting. So what do celebrities know that you don''t? Scientists have unveiled groundbreaking discoveries to hack hair growth. By penetrating the skin barrier and stimulating the dermal papilla, which is basically your hair factory, you can keep your hair in the growth cycle indefinitely, growing longer, thicker, fuller hair like you did in your 20s. The problem is that the molecules inside 90% of hair products are too big to make it past the skin barrier, and even the ones that aren''t engineered to properly stimulate the hair bulb. That''s where peptides come in. Peptides are small, bioactive molecules engineered to bypass the skin barrier and directly interact with the dermal papilla. These powerful compounds mimic the body''s natural signaling proteins, sending precise messages to awaken dormant follicles and supercharge the growth cycle. Unlike outdated remedies, peptides are scientifically proven to trigger hair growth at the source. One company leading the peptide hair care space with their breakthrough innovations in peptides is FLIR. Their multi-peptide hair serum was scientifically engineered to guarantee thicker, stronger, and healthier hair. With just one dropper applied to the scalp daily, you''ll see visible hair growth all over your head in as little as 12 weeks. I highly recommend you try Bloom before trying Harmful Solutions. They also offer a 90-day money-back guarantee with a buy-two-get-one-free. So if you''re looking for a hair care product, with a buy-two-get-one-free. So it''s risk-free and a bargain. Try Bloom now and grow thicker, stronger, fuller hair naturally."}', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2025-10-11 08:18:09.085105', '2025-10-11 08:18:28.019532');

We are a peptide hair serum company and I wanted to introduce you guys to our product called Bloom. It''s a hair serum, super lightweight, non-greasy, goes on really easy. You can apply it day or night, before or after styling. Dries really fast. I''m going to open it up so you can see what''s inside. So there we go, we''ve got this beautiful amber bottle, it''s glass, filled with bioactive peptides. I''m not sure how much you guys know about peptides, but pretty much a lot of people are moving away from the stronger drugs like finasteride, dutasteride, midoxidil, because of all the side effects, and moving more to natural remedies. Now the only problem with natural remedies, caffeine, biotin, things of that nature, and even oils, is that they''re not very strong. And so they''ve got no side effects, but they''re rather weak. Peptides are great because they''re kind of somewhere in the middle. They''re not as strong as the prescription medications, although they''re very close, but they''ve got no side effects like the natural remedies. And so right now we''re running a bundle, you buy two and you get one free, it''s $76 for all three of those, it''s a three month supply. Each bottle contains 30mg of peptides, and one dropper is 1mg, so you apply that daily. And it comes out to about $25 or so dollars per bottle, it''s one of the most affordable options in the market right now, this is a limited time offer. If you''re interested in healthier, stronger, fuller looking hair, click the link inside the description and give us a shot, we''ve got a 30 day money back guarantee on the single bottle, and we''ve got a 90 day money back guarantee if you buy the trio. So head on over there and work your way to fuller, thicker, healthier hair."}', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2025-10-11 08:18:09.62249', '2025-10-11 08:19:21.619508');

So one question we get a lot is what makes our product so unique? What''s different about it than anything else you might find on the market. And particularly this comes down to like oils and other serums. So first of all, with oils, oils are great, but oils are more so superficial. Those are going to work on top of the scalp. They''re going to help with antifreeze. They''re going to help with shine. They''re going to help with balancing the pH of your scalp. So they''re great for those things, but in terms of their ability to help regrow or grow new hair, to broaden the actual hair follicle, to give you thicker hair, they''re not necessarily great for that. So they''re really separate. In terms of serums that are on the marketplace, most of them are using more natural remedies, which are great, botanicals. You''ve got caffeine and tea tree oil and things of that nature, but those aren''t really built either for communicating at a cellular level in order to promote and stimulate hair growth that you''re looking for. Our product, on the other hand, has peptides in it. And peptides are unique in a couple of different ways. First of all, they have very small molecular weight and size, making it easy for them to get past the skin barrier. So you have top of your head, you''ve got this layer, it''s like a brick and mortar layer, and the bricks are these hardened skin cells and they''re impenetrable. You can''t get through them, but between those, the mortar, the cement in a brick wall are this liposomal matrix, these little bubbles that are tightly packed together, and that is really your way to get down deep into the dermis. You want to reach what they call the dermal papilla, which is your hair manufacturer. So what''s different about peptides? Well, they''ve got a better chance of making it through the liposomal matrix because of their small weight and size. So typically you want 500 Daltons or less in terms of your molecular mass, and you also want 500 nanometers or smaller. That''ll help the chances of getting deep down into the dermis where your hair factory is. Once they get there, they''re able to send messages to the cell, such as stimulate hair growth. We want to keep your hair in the antigen phase longer, the growth phase longer. Other things like angiogenesis, where we''re broadening or bringing more blood flow to the hair follicle to broaden that hair follicle, give you thicker hair. So those are the couple of differences between peptides and some of the other things you see in the market. It''s state-of-the-art stuff. I mean, a lot of companies you''ll see nowadays are starting to move into the peptide space. We''ve got one of the most advanced peptide products on the market. We''ve got six active biopeptides in here. GHK-CU, it''s copper tripeptide. AHK-CU, same thing. PALA-HK, GHK-BASIC, TTD-DBM. You can do the research on each of these. Open Google, open chat, compare it to the ingredients of all the products you''re using, and you will see this is cutting edge technology. So if you guys are interested, I''ve gone ahead and tagged our product in the description below. Just click that. You can buy directly through the TikTok store. And yeah, we''d love to see you guys trying out a product. We''ve got a 30-day money-back guarantee on a single product, single item. We''ve also got a 90-day money-back guarantee on the TRIO. So right now we''ve got a buy two and get a third one free, $76. It ends up coming out to about $25 a product, which is more affordable than any of the other big brands selling right now.

Celebrities like Tyra Banks, Kaira Knightley, Rikki Lake, and Jesse Nelson have all been very public about suffering from a variety of hair loss issues. Most think their secret is better medical doctors or specialized and expensive treatments. Others think they''re using basic remedies like rosemary oil or expensive shampoos and conditioners but that couldn''t be further from the truth. Baby that''s self-wasted. So what do celebrities know that you don''t? Celebrities have unveiled groundbreaking discoveries to hack hair growth. By penetrating the skin barrier and stimulating the dermal papilla, which is basically your hair factory, you can keep your hair in the growth cycle indefinitely. Growing longer, thicker, fuller hair like you did in your 20s. The problem is that the molecules inside 90% of hair products are too big to make it past the skin barrier and even the ones that aren''t engineered to properly stimulate the hair bulb. That''s where peptides come in. Knock, knock. Peptides are small, bioactive molecules engineered to bypass the skin barrier and directly interact with the dermal papilla. These powerful compounds mimic the body''s natural signaling proteins, sending precise messages to awaken dormant follicles and supercharge the growth cycle. Unlike outdated remedies, peptides are scientifically proven to trigger hair growth at the source. One company leading the peptide hair care space with their breakthrough innovations in peptides is FLIR. Their multi-peptide hair serum was scientifically engineered to guarantee thicker, stronger, and healthier hair. With just one dropper applied to the scalp daily, you''ll see visible hair growth all over your head in as little as 12 weeks. I highly recommend you try Bloom before trying Harmful Solutions. They also offer a 90-day money-back guarantee with a buy two, get one free. So it''s risk-free and a bargain. Try Bloom now and grow thicker, stronger, fuller hair naturally."}', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2025-10-11 08:18:10.512715', '2025-10-11 08:19:39.838726');

It''s not just an oil that''s gonna sit on the top of your hair and practically do nothing except make it look shiny, make it appear that it''s better, but it''s not actually fixing anything. See, a part of your hair growth ritual is nutrients. Think of your hair as like a plant. You need to water it, especially if you have curly hair, and you need to give it nutrients, and it''s picky. Don''t give it too much, because now you''re in trouble. But this water-based formula, that this Bloom Peptide Hair Serum that I''ve been using, it literally, it like evaporates instantly. Like it is, you put it on, you rub it in, it''s gone. Very lightweight, so for people who have like sensory issues or anything like that, this product is great because of how lightweight it is and the fact that it''s water-based. Another thing that makes this product different is it uses peptides, which are basically like a molecule or some type of thing. I am not a scientist, but peptides have been shown to support hair growth because they are small enough to get into your hair follicle, communicate with your hair, and do all the magical things, basically telling your hair to grow. So a lot of people have been seeing positive results with peptides, and so the company decided to just combine a water-based peptide system, and now we have Bloom.

Obviously, I have to do a hair layover, but you can see right there, it''s pretty bad. The video I just shared with you guys is what my hair looked like back around January 9th of this year. Just before I started taking this multi-peptide hair serum, you can see I had kind of a lot of balding or thinning happening up here in the front. It was super thin here in the center, which most of that is all grown back in now. Still a little thin there in the sides. I got a little spot here in the front, but a lot of that has come back. I was fortunate that I didn''t lose my hair as early as my dad did. He lost his when he was about 25. He''s totally bald up top and has the Homer Simpson thing going on around the sides. Mine didn''t happen until my mid-late 30s. I started on finasteride and took that, was working well for several months, and then had a loss of libido. Thought it was something to do with getting older. Asked my friends. None of them had an issue. So I figured exercise and diet are the same. Maybe it''s the finasteride. Decided to quit cold turkey, stopped, and the worst was yet to come. I had major depression and suicidal ideation. It was perhaps the worst year of my life, but I was able to make it through all that. In the meantime, I was searching for something that could regrow my hair without those side effects, and that''s when I stumbled into peptides. I''m gonna jump to another scene with you guys where I can show you under better light just how good my hair growth has been over this past three, three and a half months or so. Yeah, so it''s not too bad. I mean, you can see if I pull my hair back here, there''s a lot, a lot has grown in since I started using this three months ago. It''s a lot thicker up top in the center. You know, there''s a little bit here where I need some work, and obviously I''d like to thick it up a little bit there, but I can definitely get back out in public without feeling like I need to wear a hat, which is key for me. You know, it''s kind of a confidence kill when you''re losing your hair, but yeah, no side effects, which has been great. So this is what the product actually looks like. It''s called Bloom Flare. It''s pretty straightforward. I mean, it''s used once daily, and pop it open for you guys. This is the new one. So it''s this here. It''s peptide-based hair serum. And yeah, I mean, for me, it''s easy. I just fill the dropper full every day, like once a day, any time of day, usually like in the morning, like right after I get out of the shower. So dropper''s full, and then yeah, I''ll just put that normally on that space there and this one here, because that''s where I''m really losing it. And I started losing it in the center here, so I''ll just get it all up there on the crown. One thing I''d say for sure that I recommend to you guys is a derma stamp. Like I got two, I''ve got a ruler, and I''ve got a stamp. I like the stamp way more than I like the ruler, because I feel like this was like cutting out my, there''s some hair right there. I felt like this was like cutting my hair, you know, because it kind of rolls over your hair in some spots. Should probably get that clean. There''s a little something there. But this one''s way better. It''s got like a variable kind of depth, so I can like turn this and the needles come out of the bottom. So I''ll go with like a one setting, like right about there. And then I''ll just stamp that. I''ll show you guys how I do it. I''ll just grab it and stamp it in that area like that. Just press in like that in both those areas. And then usually I''ll do it over the cross, across the top of my head. And then just apply the serum directly after stamping. And I''ll do that like twice a week. Oh, that''s like my routine. It''s like everyday serum. Once or twice a week, I''ll hit it with the Dermastamp. Been going at it since January, January 9th or so. And I''ve been having some great results. So off the Finasteride, Binoxidil, not using that stuff anymore. I was, I can show you that. I have like, you know, Nioxin, all kinds of Nioxin. I had Finasteride for the longest time. I''ve got like this little pump here. I was taking for the longest time Nioxin, but I think their shampoo conditioner is fine. But these little products, I don''t know. They just don''t seem like they''re very strong. And then Binoxidil, I don''t know if you guys know this, but Binoxidil is actually a pet killer.

So I''m trying to get ahead of any hair loss that might occur due to postpartum. And let me show you what I''m gonna be doing that I actually recommend to all my clients who are dealing with hair loss or hair thinning that are using some type of scalp treatment. I like to pair it with a derma stamp. Now, especially for my clients who have antigenetic alopecia or just have some type of thinning going on and hair loss going on. If they''re using some type of treatment and I have them on a program, I definitely recommend that they use a derma stamp. Now, derma rollers are okay too. I actually prefer the stamp like this. I''ll show you what it looks like here in a second as I use it. But I prefer the stamp rather than the roller just because on the scalp, it can be a little bit easier to use and it won''t get caught in your hair the way that like a derma roller could, but either of them are totally okay. Okay, so you''re gonna use this prior to any of the scalp treatments that you''re using. Not necessarily scalp oil, that''s not really a treatment, but anything that is scalp serum or some type of hair growth treatment that I''ve put you on or your dermatologist or your trichologist actually put you on, you''re gonna be using that after you use your derma roller. So basically what the derma roller or the derma stamp is going to be doing is increasing the blood circulation in your scalp by putting little tiny, almost microscopic, like pokes into your scalp. And so what that does is it stimulates more blood flow and then it also allows the treatment that you apply to get deeper into your scalp so the treatment can do a better job because it''s actually reaching the areas that it should be reaching. You''re gonna get better results and probably quicker results as well because the treatment that you''re already paying for, you''re already applying, can actually do its job way better than just applying it on a regular scalp. You do wanna make sure that you''re cleaning your derma stamp every time in between uses. It''s very, very important. If you want a video on that and instructions on how to clean it properly, let me know in the comments and I can make a whole other video on that because it is very important. You want to have this number set at one to 1.5. For your face, your skin, and your body, it''s gonna be different than your scalp. So what I''m educating right now, just for your scalp, okay? Now, if this is your first time, I would recommend starting a little bit lower, closer to that one. If you go any less than one millimeter, it''s not gonna penetrate as deep into the scalp as you really need the treatments to penetrate into. I would actually say don''t even use this if you''re gonna be using it less than one because it''s not really gonna change your outcome a whole lot as far as the circulation and the scalp treatment, being able to get as deep as it needs because it needs to get deep, deep into the follicle layer. And if you''re not poking that deep into the scalp, into that follicle layer, then what''s the point, right? So anyways, you''re gonna set it to one to 1.5, okay? So I''m setting mine to one right now. One millimeter looks like that. So after you''ve cleaned it, all you''re gonna do is just kind of section your hair away and you''re just literally going to stamp. Just a little light pressure. You do not need to be pushing really deep into your scalp. Okay? You definitely do not want to draw any blood. If you''re drawing blood, you''re doing it wrong. You''re pushing too hard and that actually has negative effects on how well the treatments can work, okay? So since I am trying to combat any postpartum hair loss that might be occurring to me right now, I''m just gonna be applying it to these areas right here in my temples, but you can apply it in little areas the way that I am or you can apply it all over your scalp. Totally up to you. Once you''re done using it, be sure to disinfect and get it prepped for next time. And then after you''ve stamped your scalp, you''re gonna take whatever your treatment is that either I or another trichologist or a dermatologist has recommended for you. For thickening your hair, for hair growth, you''re gonna apply that after you actually puncture those little teeny tiny holes into your scalp, okay? Again, the little teeny tiny holes are allowing more scalp circulation and this treatment that I''m applying right now to my scalp is able to penetrate way deeper into my scalp. And so it''s gonna be targeting the areas that really need the amazing ingredients in my scalp treatment. I like to massage and then let it dry. And then once it''s dry, then I will gently brush out my hair. I hope this was helpful. If you got anything out of this, make sure that you''re following me and then check out my website. I have a lot of freebies, a lot of fun offers, and I''m always here for questions and concerns.

You won''t have any issues. I use a different type of oil for the base of my scalp versus like my actual extensions. For the base, I''m really focusing on stimulating extra growth and thickness. Today, I''m using a new one. It''s called Bloom Peptide Hair Serum that you can see results in as little as one month. I started by applying the serum to the top of my head above any of the extensions that I have. Then I focused on in between my two layers at the very base of my scalp. One thing I noticed about the serum is that it''s not an oil. It was a lot less oily than what I''ve used in the past. In fact, it wasn''t really even oily at all. I''ve never used a peptide before and this one actually has four different peptides included in it. Here you can see I''m actually breaking up the oils and this is what I''m running through my hair extensions. I make sure to coat it all as evenly as I can and rub it in, brush it in. I have a special brush just for that. By the end, your hair should look a little bit something like this that I''m about to show. Then I throw my hair up and I will end up sleeping in it like this.

Rapid fire. Number one. If you have curly hair, you should be treating your hair like a plant. And you''re probably like, what the hell does that even mean? It means I want you to mist your hair often. Curly hair can be extremely dry and it loves, loves, loves, loves, loves moisture. If you want bouncy light curls, your hair has to be moisturized. If you want definition in your curls, you need to moisturize. And if you want your curly hair to grow, you know you need to moisturize. What I do is I simply have a spray bottle and in the morning and before I go to bed, I mist my hair and apply oil. Another curly hair tip is take care of your scalp. A lot of people are constantly taking care of their hair, but your scalp is where the real magic happens. A lot of people have dirty, clogged, disgustingly dry scalps or they''re just like too much stuff is on their scalp. I recently started using a scalp serum and my hair growth journey has skyrocketed since I was using it. I recently got a wolf cut with like blunt layers and so I had so many different layers in my hair and it was looking so choppy and it''s finally starting to all grow back to the same length. A really good scalp serum is going to change your hair game completely. And personally, I don''t cheap out on anything. If I want to feel beautiful, I''m going to do the research and if the product''s a little bit more pricey, I have no problem investing in my own personal beauty because when I feel beautiful, I feel happy. When I feel happy, I''m a better mom, I''m a better friend, and I''m a better part of my community. Scalp serum that I started using is Fleur Bloom Peptide Scalp Serum and it uses peptides. It literally, I don''t know the science behind it, but it works. It literally works. Like, hello? It works. But I have so many more curly hair tips, so leave below in the comments and let me know like what other hair tips you guys are interested in knowing because I''ve been through so many journeys with my curly hair from straightening it every day to dyeing it blonde to growing it out and cutting it and growing it back out again.

Okay, so you''re probably wondering why I''m putting this in my hair after I just got done finishing my hair, and I think that''s one of the main things I love about this product is that it''s super versatile, so I''m able to use it in the morning, I''m able to use it during the day, during the evening, wherever it really fits in my hair care routine, and then also I''m able to use it when my hair is wet or dry. I personally use it in the morning and the evening, but there has been times where I''ve forgotten to do it in the morning, and I''ve just grabbed it with me and put it on my way to work. Okay, so the first thing we''re going to do is fill up our dropper, and you want to apply it into the key areas where your hair is thinning. So one thing I''ve noticed as I''ve gotten older is that my hair is thinning more in the front areas, like right in here, up in here, so you''re just going to put some in there, and there, put it in those key areas. You want to use gentle and circular motions when massaging this into your scalp. This helps stimulate circulation and the absorption of the peptides, which is exactly what we want. One thing I love is that this product is water-based, so it just doesn''t give that greasy feeling after you do your hair, and kind of gives you this natural instant lift, which is great for the volume. Also what I do is, after I apply it to the key areas of my scalp, I also apply it throughout my hair, too. So I just put some in my palm, get my hand, and I''ll actually run it through the bottoms of my hair. And one thing I''ve noticed from doing this is that, yes, it works on the scalp, but after I put it in the bottoms of my hair, too, it just makes my ends super soft, so it''s kind of this multi-beneficial product, which is even better. So you can use Bloom Daily, you can use it a couple times a week, whatever your hair needs and your hair goals are. I personally use it daily, just because I love what I''ve been seeing with the product as far as my hair looking thicker, it''s looking fuller, stronger at the ends, like I said, I just feel like it''s more hydrated, and I''ve noticed so much growth just in these key areas, like all this new hair growth here.

Obviously, I have to do a hair layover, but you can see right there, it''s pretty bad. The video I just shared with you guys is what my hair looked like back around January 9th of this year. Just before I started taking this multi-peptide hair serum, you can see I had kind of a lot of balding or thinning happening up here in the front. It was super thin here in the center, which most of that is all grown back in now. Still a little thin there in the sides. I got a little spot here in the front, but a lot of that has come back. I was fortunate that I didn''t lose my hair as early as my dad did. He lost his when he was about 25. He''s totally bald up top and has the Homer Simpson thing going on around the sides. Mine didn''t happen until my mid-late 30s. I started on finasteride and took that, was working well for several months, and then had a loss of libido. Thought it was something to do with getting older. Asked my friends, none of them had an issue. So I figured exercise and diet are the same. Maybe it''s the finasteride. Decided to quit cold turkey, stopped, and the worst was yet to come. I had major depression and suicidal ideation. It was perhaps the worst year of my life, but I was able to make it through all that. In the meantime, I was searching for something that could regrow my hair without those side effects, and that''s when I stumbled into peptides. I''m gonna jump to another scene with you guys where I can show you under better light just how good my hair growth has been over this past three, three and a half months or so. Yeah, so it''s not too bad. I mean, you can see if I pull my hair back here, there''s a lot, a lot has grown in since I started using this three months ago. It''s a lot thicker up top in the center. You know, there''s a little bit here where I need some work, and obviously I''d like to thick it up a little bit there, but I can definitely get back out in public without feeling like I need to wear a hat, which is key for me. You know, it''s kind of a confidence kill when you''re losing your hair. But yeah, no side effects, which have been great. So this is what the product actually looks like. It''s called Bloom Flare. It''s pretty straightforward. I mean, it''s used once daily. And pop it open for you guys. This is the new one. So it''s this here. It''s peptide-based hair serum. And yeah, I mean, for me, it''s easy. I just fill the dropper full every day, like once a day, any time of day, usually like in the morning, like right after I get out of the shower. So dropper''s full, and then, yeah, I''ll just put that normally on that space there and this one here, because that''s where I''m really losing it. And I started losing it in the center here, so I''ll just get it all up there on the crown. One thing I''d say for sure that I recommend to you guys is a derma stamp. I got two. I''ve got a ruler and I''ve got a stamp. I like the stamp way more than I like the ruler because I feel like this was like cutting out my... There''s some hair right there. I felt like this was like cutting my hair, because it kind of rolls over your hair in some spots. Should probably get that clean. There''s a little something there. But this one''s way better. Got like a variable kind of depth, so I can like turn this and the needles come out of the bottom. So I''ll go with like a one setting, like right about there. And then I''ll just stamp that. I''ll show you guys how I do it. I''ll just grab it and stamp it in that area like that. Just press in like that in both those areas. And then usually I''ll do it across the top of my head. And then just apply the serum directly after stamping. And I''ll do that like twice a week. That''s like my routine. It''s like everyday serum. Once or twice a week, I''ll hit it with the Dermastamp. Been going at it since January, January 9th or so. And I''ve been having some great results. So off the Finasteride, Binoxidil, not using that stuff anymore. I was, I can show you that. I had like, you know, Nioxin, all kinds of Nioxin. I had Finasteride for the longest time. I''ve got like this little pump here, I was taking for the longest time Nioxin. But I think their shampoo conditioner is fine. But these little products, I don''t know. They just don''t seem like they''re very strong. And then Binoxidil, I don''t know if you guys know this, but Binoxidil is actually a pet killer. I got a small dog. And they can, I can actually kill them. Just a single lick alone can kill your animal. So I pulled off of Binoxidil too. So it''s been, it''s just this peptide-based hair serum. And I''m getting the results that I want. So I''m gonna keep with it. Definitely need a haircut, but I''m gonna keep with it. And see how it goes."}', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2025-10-11 08:18:09.085324', '2025-10-11 08:58:20.926772');
